This file contains a couple different ideas to explore. In main.py there was originally only one animal displayed. However, we added a radom location and animal in many different locations which displayed a bunch of different animals. In the main2.py there was one alligator who was lonely so we added the same function and just changed the animal picture so he would have a friend. In the main3.py we had a single moose who was stuck. We used the mouse function and passed it through the moose to allow him to get out of his stuck position.
